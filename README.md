# mean-commerce
MEAN stack modules for e-commerce
In this project , I aimed to provide a practical structured and extensible solution for the e-commerce problem in a javascript powered environment.
mean-commerce would be available to download via npm as a whole framework , and I'm currently working on implementing a RESTful API that is secured for safe financial transactions.
Adding a page builder would be a plus point for this project , where users can generate their custom templates from a set of draggable items provided by the framework.

PS:
We would love to see anyone contribute to this project.
This project is an open-source , free forever base code for the general public .
